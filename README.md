I developed a unique mobile app featuring a circular timer system to help users manage their time more effectively. The app has a visually appealing dark theme and is powered by Firebase, including Firebase Authentication, Google Sign-In, and Firestore. Key features of the app include:
  - Ability to assign specific time periods for different activities
  - Progress tracking through pie-chart-like circles
  - Secure user login with Firebase Authentication and Google Sign-In
  - Cloud storage of user data, including task duration and progress
  
I am proud to have created a useful and innovative tool that helps users stay organized and productive.
